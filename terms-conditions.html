CashFree gives you the ability to make purchases at participating merchant locations or on participating merchant websites or applications. CashFree will charge your Payment Instruments stored on CashFree's or third party provider's servers for transactions using the CashFree Service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting Started with CashFree</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order to use the Processing Service, you must complete all required information elements on the CashFree registration pages. You must register a valid Payment Instrument (Credit card, debit card or netbanking account) to make Payment Transactions. CashFree does not make any representation or verify that any of your Payment Instruments are in good standing or that the issuer of your Payment Instrument will authorize or approve any purchase of Products from a merchant when you use the CashFree app in connection with that purchase. Pasfar, in its sole and absolute discretion, may refuse to approve or may terminate existing registrations for the Processing Service with or without cause or notice, other than any notice required by any Applicable Law, and not waived herein.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Using CashFree</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Buyer can use CashFree as follows: Mention the Buyer's mobile number or any other unique identifier as designated by CashFree to the Seller (Merchant) or their representatives during the buying process. The bill then appears on the Buyer's phone. The Buyer can then select any of the saved Payment Instruments or add a new Payment Instrument to make the transaction. The online payment process specific to your Payment Instrument will then be implemented. On transaction confirmation both the Buyer and the merchant are notified of the payment. By using your CashFree app using the method described above to make Payment Transactions, you authorize CashFree to charge your selected Payment Instrument for such Payment Transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Storing Payment Instruments</span></p>

Pasfar will ensure that all the databases where card data is stored in compliant with PCI DSS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Transacting on CashFree</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">CashFree facilitates a credit card or debit card purchase by a Buyer from a Seller that is registered with CashFree. CashFree stores information from Buyers, such as their Payment Instruments and shipping information. CashFree processes Payment Transactions on behalf of Sellers, as the agent of the Seller, through the appropriate credit card or debit card network, as applicable. When Buyer chooses to pay for Products with the Processing Service, Buyer authorizes the Seller to submit charges (and, in the case of refunds, credits) to Buyer's registered Payment Instrument. CashFree will assist as agent of the Seller in accessing the card networks and processing the Payment Transaction. Once Buyer's registered Payment Instrument is authorized, Buyer's payment obligation to Seller shall be deemed completed and discharged (except for Buyer's obligations in the event of a chargeback or other reversal). Purchases made are also subject to the terms and conditions governing Buyer's Payment Instrument between Buyer and the issuer of the Payment Instrument. Buyer is responsible for any charges and related fees that may be imposed under the Payment Instrument terms and conditions as a result of Buyer's use of a Payment Instrument. You acknowledge and agree that your purchases of Products are transactions between you and the Seller, and not with Pasfar or any of their affiliates. Pasfar is not a party to your Payment Transaction for the purchase of Products, and Pasfar or other Pasfar affiliates are not a Buyer or a Seller in connection with any Payment Transaction, unless expressly designated as such in the listing of the Product on the CashFree Web Site.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You may only use the CashFree Processing Service to process a Payment Transaction for a Product/Service that is purchased from a Seller through a legitimate, bona fide sale of the Product/Service. The Processing Service may not be used to process a Payment Transaction, or otherwise transfer money between a Buyer and Seller, that is unrelated to a purchase of a Product. The Processing Service may not be used to receive cash advances from Sellers or to facilitate the purchase of cash equivalents (travelers checks, prepaid cards, money orders, etc.). You may not use the Processing Service to purchase any illegal goods or services or for any other underlying illegal transaction. You agree that you will not use the Processing Service to purchase any Products that violate these Terms of Service, other policies or rules applicable to the Processing Service, or Applicable Law. Failure to comply with these limitations may result in suspension or termination of your use of the Processing Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
